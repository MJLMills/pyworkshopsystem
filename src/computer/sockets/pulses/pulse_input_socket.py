    Inverted digital input: Low input = High reading.
    For example, use a falling edge to track the start of a pulse.
    NB: Input pin must have the pull-up enabled, this powers the transistor.

    Simple digital on/off signals, buffered and scaled with transistors.
    Use them for clocks, pulses, gates. They could also produce unfiltered PWM signals, so could maybe be used for gnarly audio (loud!) or gritty CV.
    Theyâ€™ll often be used to trigger the envelopes, which are Serge-style voltage controlled slopes
    The gates are about 5-6v
